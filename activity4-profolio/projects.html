    <h3>Project 1</h3>
    <p>
      The first project is related to develop a single Web page using only two
      technologies: HTML and CSS. The project consists in creating a single web
      page with a menu at the top know as Navigation Bar. We have to include
      text describing ourself and text describing the project. Additionally, we
      need to include two images: one image is of ourself and second image is
      anything related to the project itself.
